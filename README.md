## General info
When I put the almost 600l aquarium in my flat, my wife was afraid of flooding the apartment. To calm her down I designed, programmed and made my own PCB with ESP8266.
The device, if it detects water on any of the two connected sensors, sends messages via a Telegram app and generate sound signal.
